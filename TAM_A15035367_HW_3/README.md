Limitations:
This entire course and homework has caused me to use up and lose
literally all of my brain power. I cannot stress how much I believe
this course makes students want to literally throw my computer
at the wall and rip my head off. Please reconsider the entire
design of this course, as I hope you can see how useless it is
to teach data scientists to use Javascript, the most disgusting
language. Literally everyone in the industry will look at this on
my github or anyone's and just be like "LOL why didn't he just use
matplotlib or something relevant." 
This would assignment is a limitation on my brain capacity and
mental well-being. Please see some of the citations I attached below
that I feel may enlighten everyone's minds about JS.
This entire course is cancelled.
